## Overview

Applied Python and Excel skills to data analysis using SQL, including basic machine learning techniques for exploration and prediction. These are learning artifacts that support a broader focus on cloud engineering.

The work emphasizes data cleaning, transformations, and exploratory analysis
to understand how data is prepared before being ingested into cloud-based
systems.

They are learning artifacts rather than production systems. My current focus
is cloud engineering, infrastructure, and platform-level cloud projects,
which are documented separately.
